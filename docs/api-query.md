Bowler provides a "fluent" `Query` API for building and executing refactoring scripts.
Each method returns the `Query` object as the result, allowing you to easily chain
multiple method calls one after the other, without needing to assign the query object
to a variable or reference that variable for every method call.

Example usage of the fluent API:

```python
(
    Query()
    .select_function("foo")
    .rename("bar")
    .diff()
)
```

In the example, the query object was never assigned to a variable, but you could write,
build, and execute an equivalent query without the fluent API:

```python
query = Query()
query.select_function("foo")
query.rename("bar")
query.diff()
```

Both styles are supported by Bowler, but all examples will prefer the fluent style for
clarity and brevity.

### `Query()`

Create a new query object to process the given set of files or directories.

```python
Query(*paths: Union[str, List[str]])
```

* `*paths` - Accepts either individual file or directory paths (relative to the current
  working directory), or lists of paths, for any positional argument given.
  Defaults to the current working directory if no arguments given.

### `.select()`

Start a new transform using a custom selector pattern.
Subsequent calls to `.filter()` or `.modify()` will be attached to this transform.
For a full list of predefined selectors, as well as details on defining custom
selectors, see the [Selectors reference](/docs/api-selectors).

```python
query.select(pattern: str, **kwargs)
```

* `pattern` - A **lib2to3** fixer pattern to select nodes in the syntax tree matching
  the specified elements, and capture sub-elements using the appropriate pattern syntax.
  May contain bracketed `{keyword}` tokens to be formatted by `**kwargs`.

* `**kwargs` - Optional values to format the pattern with.  Bowler will perform the
  equivalent of `pattern.format(**kwargs)`.

### `.fixer()`

Start a new transform using an existing fixer class for **lib2to3**.
Subsequent calls to `.filter()` or `.modify()` will be attached to this transform.
Filters will execute before the fixer is executed, while subsequent modifiers will
execute after the fixer.

```python
query.fixer(fx: Type[BaseFix])
```

* `fx` - A class implementing the `BaseFix` protocol, with a `PATTERN` attribute
  defining the selector and a `.transform()` method to modify matched elements.

### `.filter()`

Filter matched elements using a custom function.
For a full list of predefined filters, as well as details on defining custom
filters, see the [Filters reference](/docs/api-filters).

```python
query.filter(callback: Callback)
```

* `callback` - The custom function to call for every matched syntax tree element.
  Filter functions must accept three arguments: the matched element, the dictionary of
  captured elements, and the filename currently being processed.  A truthy return value
  will pass the matched element to the next filter or modifier function, while a falsey
  return value will short-circuit remaining filters and prevent the matched element
  from being modified.

### `.modify()`

Modify matched elements using a custom function.
For a full list of predefined modifiers, as well as details on defining custom
modifiers, see the [Modifiers reference](/docs/api-filters).

```python
query.modify(callback: Callback)
```

* `callback` - The custom function to call for every matched syntax tree element that
  passed all filter functions.  Modifier functions must accept three arguments: the
  matched element, the dictionary of captured elements, and the filename currently
  being processed.  Returned values will automatically replace the matched element
  in the syntax tree.

### `.process()`

Post-process all modifications with a custom function.

```python
query.process(callback: Processor)
```

* `callback` - The custom function to call for every "hunk" of modifications made to
  files by the query.  Processors must accept two arguments: the current filename, and
  the "hunk" being applied.  Each hunk is represented as a list of strings, with each
  string representing a single line of the [unified diff][] for that modification.
  Return values of `False` will prevent the hunk from being applied, and any other
  return value will allow the hunk to be applied automatically or interactively by
  the user.

### `.execute()`

Execute the current query, and generate a diff or write changes to disk.

```python
.execute(
    interactive: bool = True,
    write: bool = False,
    silent: bool = False,
)
```

* `interactive` - Whether the generated diff should interactively prompt the user to
  apply each hunk to each file.  When `True`, the `write` parameter is ignored.
* `write` - Whether diff hunks should be written to disk.  When `False`, diff hunks
  will only be echoed to stdout; when `True`, they will be echoed and files will be
  modified in place.
* `silent` - When `True`, diff hunks will not be echoed to stdout, and the `interactive`
  parameter is ignored.

### `.diff()`

Alias for `.execute(interactive=False, write=False)`

### `.idiff()`

Alias for `.execute(interactive=True, write=False)`

### `.write()`

Alias for `.execute(interactive=False, write=True)`

### `.dump()`

Attaches a debugging function to all transforms to dump a human-readable representation
of matched and captured elements to stdout, and then executes the query without
writing results to disk.
